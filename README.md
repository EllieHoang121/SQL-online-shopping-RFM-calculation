1. What is RFM analysis?

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to rank and group customers quantitatively based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values to gain insights into their buying behavior. The idea is to segment customers based on their last purchase, how often they have purchased in the past, and how much they have spent overall. 

This analysis helps businesses optimize marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and ultimately boost sales by targeting the right customers with the right messages or offers.

2. Project goals:
The project aims to clean and explore the customers' purchase behavior and do the RFM analysis. From that, we can have a better understanding of customers' purchase behaviors, and tailor suitable campaigns for each customer group.
